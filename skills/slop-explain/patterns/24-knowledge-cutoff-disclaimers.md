# Pattern 24: Knowledge-cutoff disclaimers

**"While specific details are limited...", "as of my last training...", "I do not have current information on..."**

## Why LLMs do this

The disclaimers exist for honest reasons. An LLM with a January 2024 training cutoff genuinely cannot speak to what happened in March 2024. The model is trained to flag the uncertainty so users do not treat its output as current.

The problem is that the disclaimers ride along into published text. When the user takes the model's output and uses it in an article, the "as of my last training" line stays in. The published text now contains a phrase that only makes sense if the author is an LLM.

The disclaimers also tend to appear when the model has nothing to say. Faced with a topic it cannot speak to, the model produces a hedge instead of admitting ignorance directly, and the hedge becomes part of the output.

## Why it reads as AI

The phrasing is unmistakable. "As of my last training," "I do not have access to real-time information," "specific details may have changed since," "while my knowledge is current as of." Humans do not use these constructions. They might say "I am not sure what has happened since 2023" but they would not say "as of my last training in 2023."

The disclaimers are also nearly useless as warnings. They tell the reader "this might be out of date" without telling them what specifically is out of date or what the writer is actually uncertain about. A real hedge ("the figures here are from the 2023 fiscal year and may not reflect post-merger changes") is informative. The LLM disclaimer is not.

## Examples

After:
> The cooperative's most recent published figures are from 2023.

Before:
> While I do not have access to the most current information, as of my last training the cooperative had been growing steadily.

After:
> Senate Bill 4012 passed the committee in March 2024. I have not tracked its progress since.

Before:
> While specific details about Senate Bill 4012 are limited as of my last training, it was at the committee stage and may have progressed since.

Notice that the human versions name what they do and do not know, with specifics. The AI versions are vague meta-disclaimers about the writer's own training rather than about the topic.

## How to self-spot

Search for the trigger phrases: "as of my last training," "my training data," "I do not have access to," "specific details are limited," "knowledge cutoff," "real-time information."

For each hit, the choice is:
1. Find the actual current information and replace the disclaimer with a fact.
2. Replace the meta-disclaimer with a topic-specific one ("figures here are from 2023").
3. Delete the sentence.

If the disclaimer is doing real work, it should be specific about *what* is uncertain, not about the writer's training.
