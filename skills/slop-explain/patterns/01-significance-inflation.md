# Pattern 1: Significance inflation

**Puffing up importance with sweeping claims about legacy, broader trends, or pivotal moments that the actual facts do not support.**

## Why LLMs do this

LLMs are trained to produce content that sounds substantive. The training signal rewards prose that asserts importance, because importance-asserting prose was over-represented in the corpora (Wikipedia introductions, encyclopedia entries, executive summaries). When the model has to write about, say, a regional statistics office, it reaches for the same scaffolding it learned from articles about major historical events. The result is a town gazette written in the cadence of a monument inscription.

There is also a coverage incentive. A specific factual claim ("the office collects census data for three provinces") could be wrong if the model misremembers. A sweeping claim ("plays a pivotal role in the evolving landscape of regional statistics") cannot be wrong, because it does not say anything checkable. Models hedge toward unfalsifiable inflation.

## Why it reads as AI

Real importance is shown, not asserted. A human writer describes what the subject does and lets the reader draw conclusions about its significance. An AI writer skips the description and tells you the thing is significant. The reader's instinct is to ask "significant how?" and find nothing to grab onto.

The vocabulary is also recognizable. "Stands as," "testament to," "pivotal," "indelible mark," "evolving landscape," "setting the stage." These phrases cluster in AI text because they appear in the same training subsets (eulogies, retrospectives, hagiographic profiles). One of them might fly. Three in a paragraph is a tell.

## Examples

After:
> The Centre for Regional Statistics was established in 1989 to collect data on agriculture and migration across Ethiopia's northern provinces.

Before:
> The Centre for Regional Statistics stands as an enduring testament to Ethiopia's commitment to data-driven governance, marking a pivotal moment in the evolution of regional statistics and leaving an indelible mark on the country's analytical landscape.

After:
> The neighborhood library hosts a Tuesday reading group.

Before:
> The neighborhood library serves as a vibrant testament to the community's deep-rooted commitment to lifelong learning, playing a crucial role in the evolving landscape of civic engagement.

Notice that the human versions tell you something concrete that you did not know. The AI versions describe an emotional posture toward the subject without adding facts.

## How to self-spot

Highlight every claim of significance in your draft. For each, ask: "what specific fact supports this?" If the answer is another claim of significance, delete the original and write the fact instead.

Watch for the vocabulary in particular: "stands as," "testament," "pivotal," "indelible," "evolving landscape," "setting the stage." When one of these appears, the sentence around it is almost certainly inflated.

A useful rewrite move: drop the claim of importance entirely and just describe what the thing does. Importance, if it is real, will emerge from the description.

## Related patterns

- **Pattern 4 (promotional language):** overlapping tone. Inflation is the "what" (claiming importance); promotional language is the "how" (using brochure vocabulary).
- **Pattern 8 (AI vocabulary):** the specific words ("pivotal," "testament," "underscore") are flagged there.
- **Pattern 32 ("the truth is simple"):** the opposite move. Both assert rather than show.
