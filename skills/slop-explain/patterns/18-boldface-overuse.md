# Pattern 18: Boldface overuse

**Mechanical emphasis on terms or phrases that do not actually need emphasis.**

## Why LLMs do this

Markdown is well-represented in training data, especially in technical documentation, blog posts, and "how-to" content. In those genres, key terms are often bolded so readers scanning the page can find them. The model learned that bold means "important" and applies it to anything that seems definition-like or topic-introducing.

The model also has no way to feel embarrassment about over-bolding. A human writer who bolds three phrases in a paragraph notices the visual noise and pulls some back. The model has no such feedback loop and keeps adding bold wherever a term seems load-bearing.

## Why it reads as AI

Bold loses its meaning when it is everywhere. If every paragraph has three bolded phrases, none of them feel important. The reader's eye has nothing to anchor to. The page looks like a textbook study guide rather than prose.

The selection also tends to be arbitrary. A human writer bolds the genuinely key term once, near its first use. An LLM bolds nearly every concept noun, including ones the reader could find without help.

Bold is most jarring in narrative or argumentative prose where it has no functional role. A blog post about a personal experience does not need bolded **fear** and **hope** and **discovery**. The bolding suggests the writer is afraid the reader will miss the words.

## Examples

After:
> The team adopted a new framework last quarter and shipped two features in six weeks.

Before:
> The team adopted a **new framework** last quarter and shipped **two features** in just **six weeks**.

After:
> What surprised me was how much resistance came from middle management.

Before:
> What surprised me was the **resistance** that came from **middle management**.

Notice that the human versions trust the reader to find the important words on their own. The AI versions decorate them, which only flattens the emphasis.

## How to self-spot

Count bold spans per paragraph in your draft. More than one is usually too many. None is often correct.

For each bolded phrase, ask: "is this a defined term, a heading, or a UI label?" If yes, bold is appropriate. If no, if it is just a phrase that "feels important," remove the bold and let the sentence carry the weight.

A useful test: render the draft without any bold and see if the meaning is clear. Almost always it is. The bold was decoration.
