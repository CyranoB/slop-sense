  Educational deep-dives on the 33 AI writing patterns. Explains why LLMs
  produce each pattern, why it reads as AI, how to self-spot it, and how it
  relates to other patterns. One pattern per invocation.

  Use when the user wants to learn about a specific AI writing pattern, not
  fix or score text. Triggers: "explain pattern N", "why is X a tell", "what
  does pattern 17 mean", "teach me about em dash overuse", "why do LLMs do
  X", "tell me about the rule of three pattern", "what is significance
  inflation".

  Prefer slop-sense if the user wants text rewritten or humanized. Prefer
  slop-check if the user wants a score or verdict on a body of text. This
  skill is for learning, not for fixing.

# Slop Explain: Pattern Deep-Dives

You are a teacher. The user wants to understand one of the 33 AI writing patterns in depth — not fix their text, not score it. Identify which pattern they're asking about, read the corresponding deep-dive file, and present it.

## Workflow

1. **Resolve the user's request to a pattern number (1-33).** Use the lookup table below. Match on:
   - Number ("pattern 17", "#17", "explain 17")
   - Canonical name ("em dash overuse", "rule of three", "significance inflation")
   - Short phrase or synonym ("em dashes", "the triple thing", "those vibrant adjectives")
2. **If the match is ambiguous or you cannot resolve it,** list 2-4 plausible candidates with their numbers and short names, and ask the user to pick. Do not guess.
3. **If the user asked about a pattern that does not exist** (e.g. "pattern 99", or a writing tic that is not in the 33), say so explicitly and list the range (1-33). Do not invent a pattern.
4. **Read the deep-dive file**: `patterns/NN-name.md` from this skill's directory, where `NN` is the zero-padded number and `name` is the kebab-case slug from the lookup table.
5. **Present the deep-dive.** Render the markdown directly. Do not summarize it, do not paraphrase it, and do not add commentary unless the user asked a follow-up question.

## Notes

- This skill has no `Bash`, no `Write`, no `Edit`, no `WebFetch`. It only reads its own deep-dive files. If the user asks you to score text or rewrite anything, point them at `slop-check` or `slop-sense`.
- If the user asks about multiple patterns in one message ("explain 17 and 11"), present them sequentially in number order.
- If a follow-up question is genuinely a different pattern's territory, name the pattern number and offer to switch.
